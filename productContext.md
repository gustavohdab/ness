# Product Context: AI Developer Candidate Matcher

## 1. Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is educational. It serves as a hands-on platform to learn and experiment with building an AI-powered matching system within a modern full-stack web application (Next.js 15, React 19, Node.js, Express, MongoDB).

## 2. Problem Solved (Learning Focus)

This project addresses the developer's need to learn:

-   How to model and manage related data (Jobs, Developers, Skills) in MongoDB.
-   How to design and implement REST API endpoints for CRUD operations.
-   How to structure a Next.js application with React 19 for data display and user interaction.
-   How to integrate an AI component (from simple keyword matching to potentially more complex vector similarity) into the backend logic to provide intelligent matching.
-   How to connect frontend components to backend APIs for a full-stack experience.

## 3. Target User Problems (Simulated)

While the primary user is the developer learning the tech, the application _simulates_ solving these problems:

-   **For Companies:** Quickly finding potentially relevant developer candidates from a pool based on required skills, reducing manual screening time.
-   **For Developers:** Getting visibility for relevant job opportunities based on their listed skills.

## 4. Vision

To create a functional, understandable, and extendable application demonstrating AI-driven matching in a realistic (though simplified) recruitment context. It serves as a practical example of integrating AI into a common web application pattern.
